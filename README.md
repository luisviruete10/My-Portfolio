My Task was to build my personal portfolio from scratch.
I didnt have no started code.
I used a lot of techniques i learned from bootcamp and even some new ones that i learned while building the site.

I met criteria with having an avatar, showing a about me section, my past work and when you click one the nav section, you'll be able to where it click on it. Also i have 2 working links that will take you to my past work. All you have to do is click on the pictures under the WORK section.
